# My Creative Development Lab

Welcome to My Creative Development Lab! This is the place where I showcase my creations related to animations, 3d visuals and creative development stuff.

## Tech Stack

I use two libraries for my creations: [Three.js](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction) (R3F - React Three Fiber) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/). Both of these libraries are really powerful tools, but I am still learning, so feel free to watch my progress here.
For physics I am using Cannon.js [@react/use-cannon](https://github.com/pmndrs/use-cannon)

## Website

This website is built using Next.js with TypeScript.


- Note: I take """inspiration""" on this page from [basement.studio](https://basement.studio/) labs. So please go check them, they are awesome.
